PETALING JAYA: Malaysia's Olympics golden dream in badminton is over with the defeat of men's doubles shuttlers Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik.

The world No. 9 pair went down 22-24, 13-21 to China's Li Junhui-Liu Yuchen in a fast-paced 38-minute match at the Musahhino Forest Sports Plaza in Tokyo on Friday.

The duo kept up with the Chinese pair in a tight opening game but eventually ran out of steam in the second game as Junhui-Yuchen storm into their first Olympics final.

They will take on Taiwan's Lee Yang-Wang Chi-lin in the gold-medal match on Saturday. In the other semi-final match-up, Lee-Yang-Chi-lin were imperious in their 21-11, 21-10 win over Mohammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan of Indonesia.

However, the quest to win a medal is not over for Aaron-Wooi Yik as they have set up a rematch against the Indonesians in the bronze-medal playoff.


Ahsan-Hendra had beaten the Malaysians in the group stage but Aaron-Wooi Yik will be out to exact sweet revenge and make sure that the badminton team will return home at least with a bronze.
